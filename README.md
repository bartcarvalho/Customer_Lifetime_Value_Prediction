# Customer_Lifetime_Value_Prediction

### Problem Statement:

To predict the Customer Lifetime Value for an insurance company offering vehicle insurance.


### Description:

Customer Lifetime Value is a commonly used metric by companies and financial institutions to assign a numeric value to their customers and thereby inform their strategy of increasing the companies profits.

It is defined as the total monetary value that a customer holds to a bank or any financial entity over the entire course of their relationship.





#### The formula used to calculate CLV is = (Annual revenue per customer x Customer relationship in years) â€“ Customer acquisition cost





The difficulty arises when some segments of customers invest a lot of money in a company over a short period of time while others might invest small sums over a longer period of time. Now, if a company were to focus only on the short-term high paying customers, they will miss out on the gradual but constant revenue invested by the latter kind of customer. Both of these kinds of customers might be of high value to the company and hence there is a need to account for these two kinds of customers as well as other factors. 


In the case of insurance, customers fall into several categories. Companies design different policies as not all categories of customers will want the same policy. Some customers might go for a greater coverage, while some might go for less. This does not mean that the customers with lesser coverage are less valuable to the company, as we must take into account the cost of acquiring these customers as well.

The insurance company must therefore study their existing customers considering all these factors to find out which category of customers to target.

The dataset contains historical data of the customers already acquired by the company and the CLV for each of these customers has been computed. We must use this previously computed CLV along with the independent variables to predict the category of customers who will be profitable to the company.

To account for all these factors this metric of customer-oriented evaluation is widely used.


### Aim:

To establish the relationship between the explanatory variables and the target variable and thereby to propose a model that can predict the target variable.

In this case, the objective is to study how the outcome variable (CLV) is related to the independent variables and the subsequent model thus proposed should help the company to make an informed decision with regard to the kind of customer to target.

It is a regression task to predict how much a given customer will be valuable to an insurance company.
